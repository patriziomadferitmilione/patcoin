Simple Python Blockchain with a PatCoin protocol

For the time being, you can download this small stack, run the code of the nodes, and use PostMan (or any HTTP client you usually use) to test it out!

I love BitCoin, I am inspired by the work of Satoshi Nakamoto, so I built this small blockchain to attempt at recreating a small very simple cousin to it with my name.
